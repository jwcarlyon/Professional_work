# Formula Uno Stats Page

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Latest Feature: Jest Testing
Unit testing for all connected components was added before connection to the back-end  

## Next up: calling the back-end
 for json and adding some more backgrounds with some fading transitions.

## Running locally
Viewing the 'web' folder in a terminal, running `$npm build && npm start`  
with the correct version of npm, should get you to the demo homepage

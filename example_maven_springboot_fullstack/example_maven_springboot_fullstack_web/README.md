This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Initial Commit
This is a basic setup for a React-Redux front-end. This should load the homepage
with a basic photo background and title.  
Next up is adding a modal to display drivers names and basic bio, calling the back-end
 for json and adding some more backgrounds with some fading transitions.

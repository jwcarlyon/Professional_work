#Python Based C++ Compiler/Explorer
##About
This is an exercise using ChatGPT-4. The promp was:
`Create a python GUI application for me that has a box for inputting a c++ program.  
Create a second box that shows me the assembly output generated by y C++ compiler.  
Update the comilation live, while I type the program.  
Provide a UI configuration option for the current optimization level and which compiler is being executed.`

The program uses TKInter and Subprocess libraries. This does not work, it may  
compile with an older version of python, but 3.6.9 sees some of the flags in the  
subprocess call as deprecated. The second commit will be my changes to get this  
program to work

The main issue was the subprocess run command was not directing the assembly code to  
the stdout, despite my intended use of the PIPE flags. This solution simply looks for the command  
to create a text file temp.s and reads it as a string. One bug is that I try to delete  
this file using the command on line 58 of compiler_explorer and see no change in the directory.

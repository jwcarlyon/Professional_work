#Python Based C++ Compiler/Explorer
##About
This is an exercise using ChatGPT-4. The promp was:
`Create a python GUI application for me that has a box for inputting a c++ program.  
Create a second box that shows me the assembly output generated by y C++ compiler.  
Update the comilation live, while I type the program.  
Provide a UI configuration option for the current optimization level and which compiler is being executed.`

The program uses TKInter and Subprocess libraries. This does not work, it may  
compile with an older version of python, but 3.6 sees some of the flags in the  
subprocess call as deprecated. The second commit will be my changes to get this  
program to work
